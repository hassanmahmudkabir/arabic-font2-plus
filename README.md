Usage
-----

To use the plugin, simply wrap your Arabic text in the `[arabic]` shortcode:

```
[arabic]هذا هو نص عربي[/arabic]
``` 

By default, the plugin will use the noorehira font. If you want to use a specific font, you can specify it in the shortcode:

```
[arabic font="Amiri"]هذا هو نص عربي[/arabic]
``` 

The plugin supports EOT, TTF, WOFF, WOFF2 And SVG font formats. To use a custom font, simply upload the font files to the `wp-content/plugins/arabic-font2-plus/fonts` directory. The font files must be named after the font family they represent. For example, if you have a font family named `Amiri`, you should name your font files `Amiri.ttf`, `Amiri.woff`, or `Amiri.woff2`.

You can also optionally specify the font size in the shortcode. The default font size is 1rem. To change the font size, add the `size` attribute to the shortcode:

```
[arabic font="Amiri" size="24px"]هذا هو نص عربي[/arabic]
``` 

You can also optionally specify the line-height aka line gap in the shortcode. The default line gap is 46px. To change the gap, add the `gap` attribute to the shortcode:

```
[arabic font="Amiri" size="24px" gap="48px"]هذا هو نص عربي[/arabic]
``` 

You May provide VALID css inside custom_css parameter, whice will be applied to your contents inside the shortcode

```
[arabic font="noorehira" size="2rem" gap="48px" custom_css="background-color:red"]هذا هو نص عربي[/arabic]
``` 

And shortcode inside of **[arabic][/arabic]** is allowed, and will execute as it would have been without **[arabic][/arabic]** .
